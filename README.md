## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs of stakeholders for a software system.  
It forms the foundation of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** by ensuring that the system being built aligns with business goals and user expectations.

## Key Steps
1. **Elicitation** – Gathering requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, etc.  
2. **Analysis & Negotiation** – Reviewing requirements, resolving conflicts, and setting priorities.  
3. **Documentation** – Creating a clear **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**.  
4. **Validation** – Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, and testable.  
5. **Management** – Handling changes and maintaining traceability throughout the project.

## Types of Requirements
- **Functional** – What the system should do (e.g., login functionality).  
- **Non-Functional** – How the system should perform (e.g., performance, security).  
- **Business** – High-level goals and objectives.  
- **User** – Expectations from end-users.

## Importance
Requirement Analysis is crucial because it:  
- Provides a **blueprint for design, coding, and testing**.  
- Reduces the **risk of project failure** by clarifying expectations early.  
- Saves **time and cost** since fixing requirement errors later is expensive.  
- Enhances **communication** between stakeholders and the development team.  
- Improves **quality assurance** by enabling test cases to map directly to requirements.

## Conclusion
A well-executed Requirement Analysis ensures that software is delivered **on time, within budget, and aligned with stakeholder needs**.  
It is one of the most critical activities in SDLC, as unclear or incorrect requirements are the leading cause of project failures.
